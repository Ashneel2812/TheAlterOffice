Below are three future improvements that can be made in this project:

1.Real-Time Analytics Dashboard:
    Implement real-time analytics using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE). This would enable users to view live updates on URL clicks and engagement metrics, making the dashboard more dynamic and actionable.

2.Advanced URL Management & A/B Testing:
    Enhance the URL management features by allowing users to edit, delete, and schedule expiration for their short URLs. Additionally, integrating A/B testing capabilities can help users optimize their links for better engagement and conversion rates.

3.Enhanced Security and Scalability:
    Integrate multi-factor authentication (MFA) and advanced rate limiting mechanisms (e.g., dynamic limits based on usage patterns) to further secure the application. Also, consider implementing distributed caching and load balancing strategies to ensure the solution scales seamlessly as the user base grows.
